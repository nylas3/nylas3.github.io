                    Beyond the Cape: Comics, Culture, and the Push for Inclusion in Media
                </h1>
                <p>
                    In the 21st century, particularly from 2010 onward, media representation has played a central role
                    in conversations regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion. In many places worldwide, communities
                    recognize and embrace their diversity and interconnectedness in ways that create a demand for media
                    that reflects this full spectrum of human experience responsibly, meaningfully, and carefully. These
                    three aspects work together to ensure that representation in media ensures that everyone can
                    potentially see themselves reflected in the stories that can shape their cultural and social
                    environments. The broad scope of media, not limited to only the ones listed prior, is among the
                    strongest influences on public perception of social and cultural groups, the construction of social
                    norms, and providers for uplifting unrepresented voices. This known strength of media makes
                    representation crucial beyond individual identity because it is a tool to increase societal cohesion
                    among diverse identity groups.
                </p>
                <p> The absence or misrepresentation of minority groups in media has long reinforced harmful stereotypes
                    and inaccurate cultural representation. This contributes to the marginalization of these communities
                    and even physical and psychological harm to the communities. Mainstream media often portrayed
                    limited and often reductive stories around race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and other
                    aspects of identity. Historically, white, male, heterosexual, and cis-gendered were the leaders in
                    shaping these portrayals. However, especially since 2010, both creators and consumers of media are
                    holding up a mirror to reality in order to fight against the alienation of different communities and
                    the distorted view of the world to global audiences that is constantly perpetuated through
                    misrepresentation.</p>
                <p> The idea of media being diverse is an idea that has been mentioned but not emphasized yet. Various
                    movements have demanded equity and fair representation in the past fifteen years. Whether it is
                    media awards, films, music, or even proposed practices in the media business, the push for
                    representation has been a historical one, with newer stars and consumers heavily contributing.</p>
                <p>
                    The #OscarsSoWhite movement between 2015 and 2016 was a pivotal movement in fighting against the
                    lack of diversity in media. In 2015, lawyer and media strategist April Reign tweeted<span class="highlight" id="highlight-1">"OscarsSoWhite they asked to touch my hair."</span>This was a response to the announcement of the acting nominations for
                    the 87th Academy Awards. All twenty acting nominations went to white actors. This hashtag aimed to
                    highlight the homogeneity in Hollywood. A study of 800 popular films by the Media, Diversity &amp;
                    Social Change Initiative at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism revealed that<span class="highlight" id="highlight-2">92% of top film directors were men and white actors played 86% of leading roles.</span> Regin later
                    described the movement she started as one that addressed more than just race because it aimed to
                    examine "the underrepresentation of all marginalized groups." Cheryl Boone Isaacs, former president
                    of the Academy, also took note of the fact that the membership of the Academy was 94% white and 77%
                    male. While this does not inherently guarantee any biases, it can explain how they could be deeply
                    entrenched within the industry's decision-making process. Reign's tweet sparked conversations across
                    Hollywood and catalyzed change in how diversity was approached, both on and off the screens. Media
                    has the power to reflect societal values. Media also has the power to challenge them and reshape
                    them.</p>
                <p> As early as 2017, the 2016 film Moonlight won Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best
                    Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards. This was the first Academy Awards ceremony that took place
                    with the systematic changes that were sparked by the #OscarsSoWhite movement. Moonlight included a
                    few of more than twenty non-white people who were nominated for awards during this ceremony. Barry
                    Jenkins, screenwriter and director of Moonlight, described the impact of #OscarsSoWhite by saying,
                    "#OscarsSoWhite had put the fact that so many people were being overlooked under a microscope.<span class="highlight" id="highlight-3"> If
                    Moonlight had come out three years earlier, I'm not sure how many people would have picked up that
                    screener."</span> Moonlight is a story with a black protagonist who navigates the difficulties, including
                    physical and emotional abuse over time, he encounters because of his identities as a gay person and
                    a gay black man. Based on the statistics provided earlier in this paper, Moonlight is among a small
                    percentage of films with a non-white lead and director, so if April Reign's hashtag provided any
                    push toward films similar to Moonlight, it also served as a catalyst for the wider industry to
                    confront its history of exclusion and reconsider its role in fostering inclusive narratives. This
                    shift, while not without its challenges, marks a critical moment in the ongoing effort to ensure
                    that media reflects the diverse realities of its global audience and empowers underrepresented
                    voices to shape their own stories.</p>
                <p> Moving away from the film industry, in music, the conversation around representation has also
                    existed for a long time and continues to gain momentum. A popular recent example of combining
                    musical artistry and this fight for diverse representation in media was Beyoncé's visual albums
                    Lemonade and Black Is King. The topics of these two albums related to the Black diaspora, African
                    culture, and African culture were much different. According to Raphaëlle Efoui-Delplanque, Lemonade
                    "recounts the intimate stages of Beyoncé's coping with her husband's adultery against a broader
                    context of patriarchal and White supremacist oppression," while Black is King, "draws on the Disney
                    movie The Lion King to tell the story of a young Black prince--and by extension, an entire
                    diaspora--who must find the genuine meaning of community and kin(g)ship." The true strengths of
                    these two projects are in how many areas of such expansive cultures Beyoncé seeks to spotlight,
                    address, and represent in a mainstream project. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-4">Efoui-Delplanque deemed Beyoncé's two projects in
                    tandem as a reaffirmation of "the need for imagery of Black people, outside of racist, White
                    supremacist representations." and projects that pose "a central question to the representation of,
                    and representativity in, Black cultures: who can represent--that is, depict and speak for--the
                    variety of Black cultures, and in what forms?"</span> Beyoncé's efforts highlight how media can serve as a
                    transformative tool for both reflection and change, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and
                    representative cultural landscape.</p>
                <p> While the push for representation includes seeing diverse faces and stories on screen, there is also
                    a push for ensuring that the creators behind the scenes reflect that same diversity. For many, true
                    representation is only found when diverse voices exist at all production levels. One specific effort
                    that Frances McDormand introduced during her speech at the 2018 Academy Awards was "inclusion
                    riders." This effort is best described as allowing A-list actors to demand that at least half their
                    set, on and off screen, consists of women and minorities." Shalini Shankar, a Professor of
                    Anthropology and Asian American studies at Northwestern wrote that "rather than meting out
                    platitudes about why diversity is important, the actress offered a contractual way forward to ensure
                    equitable hiring practices." and "with more minority representation, we can have better
                    conversations about race than simply inclusion or omission." Initiatives such as these make diverse
                    representations in media less stigmatized and more natural occurrences.</p>
                <p> One of the biggest critiques is the potential for superficial or tokenistic representation; the
                    result is characters of diverse backgrounds inserted into stories without any meaningful agency or
                    depth. Another large debate lies in the best way to achieve diverse representation. One question
                    that emerges is should the focus be on creating new stories and characters that reflect today's
                    diverse society or should it be on projects that reinterpret popular and traditional narratives with
                    a more inclusive lens? The best answer to this question is somewhere in the middle. The clearest
                    part of this debate and the response to the critics is that representation in all media matters
                    because it shapes how we see others, ourselves, and our relationships with the world around us. By
                    continuing to demand and create media that reflects the world's diversity, we can help foster a more
                    inclusive and empathetic society.</p>
                <p> While the topic has been on the ongoing evolution of representation in media, the rest of this work
                    will focus on how this area of study has affected the world of superheroes, starting from the comic
                    books and finishing up with the recent superhero films.</p>
                <p> <span class="highlight" id="highlight-5">The superhero genre</span> is one of the most unique areas of media when it comes to diverse
                    representation. With many of them protecting the world from evil, a lot of them share different
                    origin stories and backgrounds. While this genre was not always the most representative of diversity
                    in the real world, recently, the transformation of superheroes into a vibrant world of diversity has
                    fundamentally changed the way it is viewed. The genre is quickly moving past homogenous portrayals
                    in order to embrace a wider spectrum of identities and narratives. The shifts that occurred have
                    enriched the cultural fabric of superhero storytelling because they align with the realities of an
                    increasingly diverse audience. Richard Douglas Jones, the co-host of Black Nerd Power, emphasizes
                    one example of how Black superheroes in films like Black Panther and Suicide Squad are positive
                    steps that prove the notion that white audiences dominate the market to be outdated. Devin Faraci of
                    BirthMoviesDeath.com highlights how, in the 2021 Hollywood Diversity Report, diverse films achieved
                    higher global box office returns. This evidence of financial success, combined with the early
                    statistics of the lack of diversity in popular films, indicates a lingering disconnect between
                    representation and audience realities. This disconnect stems from outdated data and ingrained biases
                    within Hollywood, which often fail to recognize the global appeal of diverse superhero narratives.
                </p>
                <p> The tension between universal ideals and specific identities in superhero storytelling is at the
                    heart of creating and uplifting more diverse stories. The concept of a "generic superhero" raises
                    questions about what specific trade-offs are involved in prioritizing broad appeal over
                    individuality. The basic structure of a generic hero is often someone with supernatural powers who
                    symbolizes courage, justice, and resilience. These features may offer universality but lack specific
                    aspects of depth and complexity that could come from distinctive cultural and social contexts. The
                    characters that are grounded in specific identities resonate more deeply with audiences because
                    their unique struggles and triumphs are a reflection of some aspect of the audience's lived
                    experiences. The more well-established superheroes with these specific identities have historically
                    been white, cis-gendered, male, and heterosexual. Introducing characters that have identities
                    outside these "norms" and become as popular or more popular has been difficult for creators to do.
                    <span class="highlight" id="highlight-7">This difficulty is exacerbated by trademarking the term "superhero" by Marvel and DC Comics.</span> This
                    consolidated their power over the industry and dampened the progressive creativity of small creators
                    because it is much harder to enter the genre that is dominated by these two companies. However, as
                    this genre continues to evolve, the multiverse concept emerged as a powerful tool to address these
                    concerns. Creators have the ability to explore the "what ifs" of superhero narratives and create
                    entirely new people who become the next versions or alternate versions of well-established heroes.
                </p>
                <p> The methods this investigation will employ start with a close textual analysis of the implications
                    of major superhero storylines in comic books and films that employ the multiverse as a narrative
                    tool. This will examine how different versions of well-established characters, settings, and
                    identities are portrayed across these alternate realities. Eventually, it will be seen that the
                    alternate universes or realities allow for a greater exploration of diverse identities.
                    Additionally, the analysis will draw on critical reviews, scholarly interpretations, and even fan
                    discussions to provide a large range of understanding of the reception of these storylines by
                    critics and audiences. These reviews will highlight the cultural and social significance of the
                    portrayal offered to provide insights into how successfully or unsuccessfully they resonate with the
                    audiences that receive them. Fan reception will be considered because it will show an understanding
                    of how the inclusion of diverse identities and characters affects the broader comic book community
                    and general consumers outside of the community. The consideration of both critical and popular
                    responses will provide a comprehensive view of how diversity and representation in superhero comics
                    are negotiated by creators and received by audiences. These methods provide the framework for
                    analyzing how the multiverse, as a narrative tool, has become a significant vehicle for diversity in
                    superhero media, allowing for multiple identities to coexist and reshaping the way audiences engage
                    with beloved characters and their evolving stories. This investigation will focus on key examples
                    from superhero comics and related media to showcase how this device functions both as a means of
                    representation and continuity.</p>
                <p> One significant pillar of the experience in engaging with a superhero comic book storyline is the
                    relation of different parts of a superhero's identity to oneself. Another significant pillar is the
                    imaginative aspect of pairing characters together for a common goal or a duel, who seemingly cannot
                    interact by logical boundaries.  <span class="highlight" id="highlight-8">The multiverse is one of the devices within the comic book medium
                    that has grown and developed within the medium that enhances these two pillars of engaging with
                    superhero comics and their related media.</span> In its simplest definition, the multiverse is the idea
                    that there are different realities, whether universes or Earths, that are connected into one larger
                    universe in which characters can find ways to move across the different realities. Regarding the
                    first pillar of identity, the multiverse allows multiple types of people to be considered equally
                    the same superhero without experiencing continuity conflicts. For the second pillar, the multiverse
                    allows comic book creators to tell stories that combine characters across time periods or separate
                    worlds with a logical explanation. The multiverse began as a critically acclaimed tool in superhero
                    comic books and has since been adapted to television shows and films. From the comic book Flash
                    #123, published in 1961, to the film Spider-Man: Across the SpiderVerse, released in 2023, the
                    multiverse has transformed in its functionality and reception by fans. After analyzing multiple
                    superhero comics, comic book movies, receptions by fans, artists, and critics, and scholarship
                    surrounding superhero comics media, it is clear that the multiverse in superhero cartoons and comics
                    media acts as a literary device for injecting representation of different identities and their
                    stories into beloved characters without compromising the values and ideas of those specific
                    characters or simply creating new characters. Additionally, it works as a method of stretching the
                    lifespan of universally celebrated superheroes. These two uses are not mutually exclusive and
                    sometimes can work in tandem.</p>
                <p> While the first use of the multiverse is not universally agreed upon, <span class="highlight" id="highlight-9">Flash #123, commonly referred
                    to as The Flash of Two Worlds, written by Gardner Fox, is one of the earliest introductions of the
                    multiverse to superhero comics and is seen as a significant pillar in the proper ways to utilize the
                    multiverse.</span> In this story, Barry Allen, the Silver Age Flash, unintentionally vibrates his
                    molecules, disappears, and ends up in Keystone City of Earth-Two. It is there that he encounters Jay
                    Garrick, the Golden Age Flash. A key point in this encounter is that to Barry Allen, the Golden Age
                    Flash is a fictional comic book character on his Earth. Coincidentally, Jay Garrick retired as the
                    Flash on his Earth during the same year as the comic book line of the Golden Age Flash of Barry
                    Allen's Earth was canceled. However, after a recent stretch of crimes by three villains of the
                    Golden Age Flash and the opportunity for Barry Allen to work together as a team to stop them, Jay
                    Garrick comes out of retirement. In the end, they are successful. Barry Allen successfully returns
                    to his home, but Jay Garrick remains unretired. This story was critically acclaimed because of its
                    ability to explore themes of legacy and heroism across different time periods of comic book
                    production. The Alley Awards from the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors were among the first
                    recognized comic book fan awards. In its first iteration in 1962, The Flash of Two Worlds won the
                    award for having the best story. Critical acclaim and building on what this story established as a
                    viable connection of different realities across time and space laid the foundation for future
                    narratives within the DC Comics universe and even Marvel Comics.</p>

                    Earths.</span> This twelve-issue limited series aimed to condense the established but unclear multiverse in
                    DC Comics since 1961 into a unified and digestible universe. In this story, the Anti-Monitor, a
                    being with immense strength, aims to destroy all existing parallel universes. Heroes and villains
                    from various Earths work together to combat this threat. Towards the end of the story, the
                    Anti-Monitor is weakened but has the capacity to trigger a wave of antimatter that will destroy the
                    remaining universes. Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, sacrifices himself by running around the
                    Anti-Monitor's antimatter device, which destroys him and the wave. This ends the threat to the
                    remaining Earths. The remaining heroes gather at the dawn of time to merge the five Earths that have
                    survived into one universe. It saves their reality within the story and establishes a new
                    streamlined continuity for the DC Universe outside the story. Writer, editor, and independent
                    scholar Andrew J. Friedenthal described the work as showing "the two major superhero comic book
                    publishers (DC Comics and Marvel Comics) how they could utilize the continuity established by
                    decades-worth of stories to weave together a cohesive, metatextual tapestry that both appealed to
                    long-time readers and brought in massive amounts of money." This particular comic book storyline is
                    considered a significant influence in all future crossover events. They began to be anticipated by
                    fans and frequently put out by comic book publishers. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-11">Thirty-four years after the initial
                    publication, the CW adapted this storyline into their superhero comic book related television
                    multiverse.</span> Author Ryan Fritz captures why Crisis on Infinite Earths became so popular. He concluded
                    his dissertation by saying, "The American people do not know what the future holds in store for
                    them, but one semblance of hope they can cling to is that superheroes will always be there with them
                    to help them get through the uncertainty." This comic book storyline is representative of one that
                    encapsulates people with different opinions and ways of life coming together to solve a problem that
                    forces them to put those differences aside. Audiences of this comic storyline could see themselves
                    attached to different characters based on their interactions with other characters and in new
                    environments. The multiverse provided the literary blending element to explain this narrative
                    logically.</p>
                <p> While this initial multiverse concept enabled the multitude of character portrayals without
                    disrupting continuity. With this, comic artists were forming the tools to express diverse identities
                    and visual styles. For example, the art style of the Silver Age is not identical to the style of the
                    Bronze or Golden Age. These differences also extend beyond the art and divergent themes, personality
                    traits, and stories emerge. However, specific art choices in comic books are how we can
                    differentiate many of the identities of these characters. In his review of Jeffrey A. Brown's Super
                    Bodies: Comic Book Illustration, Artistic Styles, and Narrative Impact, Ryan L. Johnson writes that
                   "In the vast majority of superhero comics, the protagonists are displayed as perfect physical
                    specimens. In part, this stems from comics' well-known status as (male) adolescent power fantasies,
                    offering an example of the hypermasculine ideal body that a reader would wish to have. Or, in the
                    case of hypersexualized female bodies, a figure that the presumed-male audience would fantasize
                    about dating." While these two ideas have been a standard across the history of superhero media
                    production, the multiverse allows for the flexibility of the characters that are known and loved to
                    not fit these standards. While the physical appearance of the body is one avenue of change that can
                    be altered through an alternate reality, all of the other avenues such as race, gender, sex, sexual
                    orientation, and more can appear in a multiversal story. By presenting alternative bodies and
                    powers, multiverse stories highlight the versatility of the human form that may be apparent in real
                    life but not always reflected in media. The multiverse further enhances the exploration of diverse
                    representation in media because it connects different portrayals of characters within one
                    overarching narrative framework. This approach allows for radical reimaginings of familiar heroes,
                    such as female, differently abled, or ethnically diverse versions of classic figures, underscoring
                    the adaptability of the superhero form. By pushing the boundaries of bodily representation, the
                    multiverse embodies a vision of infinite potential, where the same character's core essence can be
                    explored from various perspectives. This mechanism celebrates diverse identities and acknowledges
                    the body as a powerful aspect within multiversal stories.</p>
                <p> In moving to twenty-first century examples of the multiverse and injecting diversity and
                    representation in superhero comics and their related media, Captain America and Spider-Man are
                    strong examples of superhero mantles that become attached to specific characters. To many,<span class="highlight" id="highlight-13"> Steve
                    Rogers is Captain America, Peter Parker is Spider-Man, Captain America is Steve Rogers, and
                    Spider-Man is Peter Parker.</span> This perspective limits the mantles to only those characters unless they
                    experience something like death that disables them from continuing to be that superhero. In
                    exploring the superhero as a mantle and not linked to one specific character, the following
                    questions arise: Why do comic book artists choose to create characters to pick up the mantle instead
                    of creating an entirely new mantle? Why is the representation of different social identities in
                    superhero comics impactful? How does the multiverse act as a reasonable explanation for these
                    changes that are not always received positively? Investigating stories of Captain America, Superman
                    and Spider-Man work to show how superhero comic books and their related media have addressed these
                    questions.</p>
                <p> Starting with Captain America, in 2003, Captain America was first envisioned as an African-American
                    man. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-14">Truth: Red, White, and Black, published as a seven-issue limited series written by Robert
                    Morales, transplants the origin of Steven Rogers' Captain America to the 40-year Tuskegee
                    Experiments on African-American Men starting in 1932.</span> In this comic book series, which is set around
                    this time, Isaiah Bradley becomes the sole survivor of these experiments and is effectively Captain
                    America. The outcome of this limited series was a direct confrontation of a tragic portion of
                    American history through the superhero comics medium. Within the story, Steve Rogers, the Captain
                    America of the present, learns about the Super Soldier's experimentation with Black soldiers in the
                    past, which eventually led to his ability to become Captain America. After learning this, Rogers
                    sought out Bradley's family to address the complexity of his own origin. A potential issue here is
                    continuity. The artists on the comic explained that they "got a lot of grief from the Captain
                    America fans on that series until the fifth and sixth issues came out; when it turned out that we
                    hadn't tinkered with the continuity." Another issue that arises among critics, fans, and creators
                    alike is the issue of racist and racially insensitive perceptions of the work when such a
                    significant change is made to the identity of a famous superhero mantle. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-15">Axel Alonso, an editor of
                    this comic, stated, "There are the fanboy continuity purists who don't like Marvel messing with
                    sacred cows; those who worry the series will somehow besmirch Steve Rogers' "legacy" and "outright
                    racists who just don't like the idea of a black man in the Cap uniform."</span> Alonso's thoughts were
                    confirmed as sales experienced a significant decrease from the first to the last issue. However,
                    there were areas where the comic book did receive critical acclaim. Ultimately, the comic would go
                    out of print in 2009 and would not return until 2020, when after George Floyd's death, Marvel began
                    highlighting comic books by Black creators. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-16">Additionally, including parts of Isaiah Bradley's story
                    in the Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU) lent itself to its re-emergence.</span> Michael Kobre acknowledges
                    how the MCU's piecemeal inclusion of Bradley's story that removes critical aspects from the original
                    comic is a revision that acknowledges the place of Bradley's story but has a limiting factor that
                    maintains the status quo of superhero comics and its strong attachment of one character to a mantle.
                    While this is not directly a multiverse story but has the potential to be, it is a crucial example
                    in understanding the reasons and responses to injecting diverse representation, exploring real-world
                    issues, and speaking to larger audiences that can gain meaningful visibility when Captain America's
                    legacy encompasses African-Americans.</p>
                <p> Similarly, Ta-Nehisi Coates and J.J. Abrams have started the process of creating a film that would
                    feature a Black Superman as its protagonist. While Isaiah Bradley's Captain America offers a layered
                    critique of America's racial history,  <span class="highlight" id="highlight-17">a Black Superman exemplifies how an iconic hero could be
                    adapted in a way that would resonate deeply with Black audiences.</span> However, some potential consumers
                    of this community feel this would not resonate with anyone.   <span class="highlight" id="highlight-18">Twitter user @Chukwu77, a Black man,
                    reacted to the potential film by saying, "MAN STOOOOP. I DO NOT WANT A BLACK SUPERMAN MOVIE. I
                    REPEAT. I DO NOT WANT A BLACK SUPERMAN MOVIE. STOP TOKENIZING WE HAVE JOHN STEWART HENRY IRONS
                    VICTOR STONE STOP F*****G TOKENIZING BLACK PEOPLE"</span> This response provides an interesting dialogue
                    combining the conversations of diverse art styles and the idea of superhero identities as being set
                    in stone as the original. Superman's origin includes being from a fictitious planet, Krypton, and
                    being sent to Earth and raised as an American man named Clark Kent. Superman debuted in 1938, when
                    most, if not all, of the superheroes that received publishing were white. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-19">In the minds of many
                    superhero media consumers, Superman, Ka-El, and Clark Kent are only able to be portrayed as a white
                    cis-gendered male.</span> The notion of Superman not being white appears to even be out of the realm of
                    possibility for even a black person because representation in media is engaged in the fight of
                    whether new characters should be built entirely or if current and established characters are able to
                    be fully reimagined without undergoing an identity change. With the multiverse, a black Clark
                    Kent/Superman can exist in a universe or reality different from a white Clark Kent/Superman.
                    <span class="highlight" id="highlight-20">However, while it is yet to be seen how this could play out on the big screen, the Spider-Man
                    character provides an interesting way to resolve this potential storyline.</span></p>
                <p> The Spider-Man mantle provides a unique perspective that explains how a more developed story,
                    including the multiverse, engages with questions surrounding diverse stories and proper ways to take
                    on those challenges in a way that does justice to the story and each character.<span class="highlight" id="highlight-21"> Regarding the
                    live-action films of Spider-Man characters, Spider-Man's character is Peter Parker, but he is played
                    by Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland.</span> There will always be a debate on who played the
                    role best and which actor is Spider-Man. Additionally, there was a long interest in seeing them
                    simultaneously share the screen as Spider-Man. The multiverse was the way to bring them together in
                    the 2021 film Spider-Man: No Way Home. In this film, fans see the actor that resonated with them the
                    most, Spider-Man, working with the other two actors' versions. In terms of diverse stories,
                    Spider-Man: No Way Home also extends the life of the Spider-Man character as fans age and new fans
                    emerge. Toby Maguire's Spider-Man was last visible to fans of the character approximately fourteen
                    years before Spider-Man: No Way Home. Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man was last visible to fans of the
                    character approximately seven years before Spider-Man: No Way Home. In that time, fans of those
                    Spider-Man characters could have decided to stop following the character as Tom Holland's character
                    did not match what they got out of the previous iterations. Seeing them interact with Tom Holland's
                    character and seeing parts of their versions being transplanted onto his Spider-Man and Peter Parker
                    allows for any gap between the versions to be, at the minimum, slightly reduced. The multiverse
                    retained its original use within this film in allowing three seemingly disconnected versions of the
                    same character to come together, logically adding to each character's stories and building a
                    satisfactory overall story.</p>
                <p> <span class="highlight" id="highlight-22">Savannah Sanders, a writer for The Direct, strongly argues that Spider-Man: No Way Home is heavily
                    influenced by the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. </span>This film is the first Spider-Man film
                    to focus on the story of Miles Morales, a non-Peter Parker Spider-Man. Before analyzing anything
                    about the 2018 film and its impact on superhero comics and related media, the significance of Miles
                    Morales is similar to that of Isaiah Bradley's Captain America. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-23">In 2010, Donald Glover became a
                    person of interest for the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man.</span>
                    While it did gain some public attention, he did not get the role. However, social discourse among
                    comic book fans was divided on the potential casting of a black Peter Parker. Around the same time,
                    Marvel Comics killed off Peter Parker within their "Ultimate" line of comics set in an alternate
                    universe than the main line. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-24">In Ultimate Fallout #4, a Black and Hispanic character, Miles Morales,
                    is introduced as the new Spider-Man. </span> The fan reactions to Miles Morales were complex and divided,
                    which reflects potential racial unease in seeing non-white people assume superhero mantles that have
                    always been carried by white people. Most positive comments echoed Axel Alonso, Marvel's Editor in
                    Chief at the time, who said, "Miles is a character who not only follows in the tradition of
                    relatable characters like Peter Parker but also shows why he's a new, unique kind of Spider-Man--and
                    worthy of that name." One of the comments, particularly against Miles Morales' creation, stated, "It
                    is wrong to kill off Peter and replace him with anyone, Race does not matter; it is wrong no matter
                    what the color. Peter Parker is Spider-Man." Regardless of positive or negative sentiments about
                    this newer Spider-Man, it grew popular enough for Sony to plan and develop three films featuring the
                    character.</p>
                <p> The 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and its following installments have significantly
                    contributed to animated films and comic book art. Within this investigative essay, the film's
                    message serves as the point of debate. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-25">The main message of the telling of Miles Morales' story in
                    the first film is that Spider-Man is a mantle that is not relegated to only one person or, more
                    simply, "Anyone can wear the Mask."</span> This is visible through the inclusion of different types of
                    Spider-characters. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-26">Between the 2018 film and its sequel, some of the identities depicted holding the
                    mantle are Peter Parker, a white man, Miles Morales, a black and Puerto Rican teenager, Gwen Stacy,
                    a white woman, Miguel O'Hara, a Latino man, Jessica Drew, a black woman, Pavitr Prabhakar, an Indian
                    teenager, and Peni Parker, a young Japanese girl. Beyond humans, a pig, a Lego, and a wolf are also
                    shown with the abilities of Spider-Man.</span> In each case, they are their universe's one and only
                    Spider-hero. They help each other learn and grow into stronger heroes when interacting with each
                    other and their unique universes. One commentary by Professor Dru Jeffries at Wilfrid Laurier
                    University regarding the plot point of Peter Parker serving as a mentor of how to be Spider-Man to a
                    different universe's Miles Morales explains that "Peter Parker's primacy over Miles Morales is
                    maintained even as Miles is promoted as the central character of the film." He explains that while
                    the message of anyone or anything being able to be envisioned as Spider-Man, the fact that the film
                    is animated and not live-action does not place Miles Morales as an equal Spider-Man figure as Peter
                    Parker. However, as Savannah Sanders argued, the success of Miles Morales' Spider-Man films
                    influenced the success of Peter Parker's Spider-Man films. The Miles Morales films successfully
                    transferred the idea of the multiverse in comic books to spaces of superhero films to connect
                    disconnected realities of different characters and show how diverse stories can be built apart and
                    eventually displayed within a community. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-27">The 2022 film Dr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is
                    the MCU's first live-action display of the multiverse. In this film, examples like Captain America
                    being Captain Peggy Carter, Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four working with Professor X of the
                    X-Men, or Captain Marvel being Captain Maria Rambeau in an alternate universe is a reflection of
                    both logically combining different heroes together and creating the room for different people with
                    different identities to carry the mantles of different heroes.</span> It is a testament to the impact of
                    Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse on superhero comic book films' use of the multiverse as a literary
                    device that serves both logical narrative and diverse narrative purposes.</p>
                <p> Before concluding this investigation of the multiverse, the question of the best method for
                    injecting diverse characters and stories into superhero comics and their related media remains
                    unanswered. As evidenced by the findings displayed in this essay, the debate will remain unsolved.
                    Given that the multiverse allows for infinite possibilities, creators can continue to create and
                    have spaces to explore diverse characters and storylines separate from established canon, become
                    their own canon, or find their place in the already established canon. However, critics will
                    continue to argue that heavy reliance on the multiverse for this purpose eventually leads to
                    tokenizing these characters and their stories. Relegating to alternative realities or creating their
                    own spaces creates the illusion that they don't organically belong in spaces considered the main
                    narrative. However, it is also visible that creating new characters or giving different characters
                    chances to assume heightened roles in these main narrative spaces also has its struggles. </p>
                <p> One popularly proposed situation is to simply create new superhero comic characters. When Robert
                    Morales wrote Isaiah Bradley's Captain America or Miles Morales was created, why couldn't they have
                    been given new powers and their own unique mantles? <span class="highlight" id="highlight-27">Writer Vaneta Rogers tackles this idea by
                    explaining the factors that limit this optimistic yet misguided question. Her first argument deals
                    with the inherent preference for familiarity. Audiences often believe they need something new, but
                    it is really a craving for the appearance of novelty with a sense of familiarity. Rogers also
                    believes there is a strong resistance to change.</span> Due to this resistance to change, artists and comic
                    book publishers often do not have the financial patience to wait for new characters to become
                    well-received eventually. If completely new characters are not finding sizable audiences, they are
                    often shelved in favor of newer versions of previously established characters. The market for
                    superhero characters will forever be saturated with older characters, which causes difficulty for
                    new ones to break through. Nostalgia is one of the most significant factors in maintaining the grip
                    that older superheroes have on the market. While there are exceptions to these arguments, in most
                    cases, older characters currently hold priority in the superhero comic book medium, whether through
                    the multiverse or not. While it is clear that the debate about the best way to inject diverse
                    stories and representation seemingly produces no sufficient answer or direction to satisfy all who
                    engage with superhero comics and related media, it highlights a need for a balanced approach that
                    aims for impactful and meaningful representation of diverse audiences and their desires.</p>
                <p> Overall, investigating the multiverse in superhero comics and related media reveals a significant
                    stamp on storytelling, representation, and the longevity of beloved characters. Looking through the
                    lens of identity and creativity, the multiverse is a function of storytelling that combines worlds,
                    includes and defines diverse characters and narratives, and maintains the longevity of established
                    heroes. The evolution of this tool from the comic books The Flash of Two Worlds, Crisis on Infinite
                    Earths, and Ultimate Fallout #4 to the films Spider-Man: No Way Home, Spider-Man: Into the
                    Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse demonstrates its versatility and relevance
                    across different mediums within superhero comics and their related media and a diverse and
                    ever-changing audience group. In MCU's films, the multiverse has cemented itself as the next
                    cornerstone of storytelling, allowing writers, directors, and actors to develop stories that display
                    characters transcending the boundaries of time, space, and reality in ways that satisfy fans. Fans
                    of Isaiah Bradley and his role as the first African-American Captain America in comic books inspired
                    the upcoming <span class="highlight" id="highlight-28">2025 film Captain America: Brave New World, which will show Sam Wilson, the first
                    African-American Captain America in live-action superhero films.</span> However, Steve Rogers has been a
                    popular MCU character since 2011. With the multiverse, storytellers can have both versions of
                    Captain America sharing the screen while holding the mantle simultaneously. The different identities
                    and stories built for those characters and the fact that different fans resonate with different
                    parts of the story can be equally acknowledged and respected if the multiverse is used to bring them
                    together. A debate on whether the multiverse is lazy or the best way to tell stories like these
                    remains ongoing. Ultimately, the key seemingly relies on catering to general audiences' core values
                    of fresh content with subtle or underlying familiarity. Creators will continue prioritizing
                    meaningful representations and inclusivity. So, the multiverse will remain in mind for superhero
                    comics and related media's continuing evolution to resonate with today's audiences and future
                    audiences of all backgrounds.</p>
                <p> Therefore, it is clear that representation in media plays a vital role in creating an inclusive
                    cultural narrative; the superhero genre is only a section of it. <span class="highlight" id="highlight-29">However, by embracing diversity in
                    its many forms, superhero media contributes to and is often a leader in the broader movements to
                    increase diversity across creative industries. The increasing number of identity groups that can
                    view themselves in a heroic light only works to combat wrong, outdated, and offensive stereotypes
                    and perceptions of them.</span></p>
